Cheerful and happy was his mood,
He to te poor was king and good,
He to the poor was kind and good,
And he oft' times did find them food,
Also supplies of coal and wood,
He never spake a word aws fude,
And cheer'd those did o'er sorrows brood,
He passed away ot understood,
Because no poet in his lays
Had penned a sonnet in his praise,
'Tis sad, but such is world's ways.
